    You and Heybarn both waive the right to trial by jury in all arbitrable
    disputes. You and Heybarn also both acknowledge and agree that we are each
    waiving the right to participating as a plaintiff or class member in any
    purported class action or representative proceeding in all such disputes.
    Further, unless You and Heybarn otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration
    will be conducted on an individual basis and not in a class, collective,
    consolidated, or representative proceeding.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    <br/>
    Any decision or award as a result of any such arbitration proceeding shall
    be in writing and shall provide an explanation for all conclusions of law
    and fact and shall include the assessment of costs, expenses, and
    reasonable attorneys’ fees. Any such arbitration shall be conducted by an
    arbitrator experienced in the “Sharing Economy,” and shall include a
    written record of the arbitration hearing. The parties reserve the right to
    object to any individual who shall be employed by or affiliated with a
    competing organization or entity. An award of arbitration may be confirmed
    in a court of competent jurisdiction. The parties shall endeavour to settle
    any such dispute via good faith negotiation prior to initiating any
    arbitration proceeding.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    <br/>
    Exceptions to this arbitration provision include (i) any claim related to
    actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a
    party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other
    intellectual property rights; or (ii) any claim seeking emergency
    injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances. Any claim in exception to
    the above agreement to arbitration shall be brought into judicial
    proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction in Dunedin, New Zealand.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    <br/>
    If any portion of this arbitration provision is found to be unenforceable
    or unlawful, those unenforceable or unlawful portions shall be severed from
    these terms. The severance of unenforceable or unlawful portions of this
    arbitration provision shall not have any impact on the remainder of the
    arbitration provision, which shall be given full force and effect.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    <br/>
    To the extent any disputed matter arising out of or relating to these Terms
    is deemed to not be subject to these arbitration provisions, such portion
    of any disputed matter shall be brought exclusively in the federal and
    state courts located within the State of Utah, and the parties do hereby
    submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.
